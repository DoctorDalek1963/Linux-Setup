This is a small, simple repo to hold files that go in my home directory when I run Linux.

It contains .vimrc, .bash_aliases, .bashrc, and .gitconfig files that go in the home directory. It also contains a setup script to automatically move and source these files, asking the user to confirm the movement of each.

This setup script also has options to install vim-plug and Vundle, as well as installing all the plugins listed in .vimrc.
