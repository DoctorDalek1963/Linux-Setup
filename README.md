This is a small, simple repo to hold files that go in my home directory when I run Linux.

It contains lots of configuration files. It also contains a setup script to automatically move and source these files, using command line arguments. Do `./setup -h` or `./setup --help` for help.

The setup script also has options to install vim-plug and Vundle, as well as installing all the plugins listed in .vimrc.
